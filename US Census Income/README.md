## Overview
This tutorial shows how to use BigQuery TensorFlow reader for training neural network using the Keras sequential API.



## Dataset
This tutorial uses the [United States Census Income Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income) provided by the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). This dataset contains information about people from a 1994 Census database, including age, education, marital status, occupation, and whether they make more than $50,000 a year.
