## Overview
1. This lab is an introduction to linear regression using Python and Scikit-Learn. This lab serves as a foundation for more complex algorithms and machine learning models that you will encounter in the course. We will train a linear regression model to predict housing price.
2. In this notebook, we will explore data corresponding to taxi rides in New York City to build a Machine Learning model in support of a fare-estimation tool. The idea is to suggest a likely fare to taxi riders so that they are not surprised, and so that they can protest if the charge is much higher than expected.
